# colorful.kst v2

This repository holds the nearly-finished colorful.kst v2 shop software which I developed on the SwitchCraft 3 Minecraft server. However as I was nearing the completion of the shop, it was announced that the server was going to shut down, so I lost all motivation. I am uploading this code here hoping that someone will continue on my idea on another server using a new currency.

Currently implemented features:

- Item purchasing
- Balance keeping
- Separate frontend and backend (coordinator)
- Increased modularity (Sort of?)
- No communication reliant on outside services
- Shulker filler
-

Intended features that were never completed:

- Coupons and rewards
- Online tracking software

## Continuation of this project

Though I don't intend on adding new features myself, please feel free to implement your own changes! I am open to pull requests as long as they don't break anything. Also, documentation is needed, so if you want to document be my guest.

## Re-use

You are free to use this software on another Minecraft server, or use parts of the code within this repository. However, if you make any major changes the license on this repository requires you to make those changes public. Also, if you choose to reuse this on another server, please choose an original name and don't re-use colorful.kst.
